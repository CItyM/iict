                        Information security, often referred to as InfoSec, refers to the processes and tools designed
                        and deployed to protect sensitive business information from modification, disruption,
                        destruction, and inspection.

                        <p>
                            Information security and cybersecurity are often confused. InfoSec is a crucial part of
                            cybersecurity, but it refers exclusively to the processes designed for data security.
                            Cybersecurity is a more general term that includes InfoSec.

                        <p>
                            An ISMS is a set of guidelines and processes created to help organizations in a data breach
                            scenario. By having a formal set of guidelines, businesses can minimize risk and can ensure
                            work continuity in case of a staff change. ISO 27001 is a well-known specification for a
                            company ISMS.
