                    <p>Fundamentally, to learn how to become a software developer is the same as to pursue any career
                        path: hard work will truly determine success, not talent. But despite this undeniable truth,
                        society continues to misconceive software development to be an industry exclusive to
                        particularly niche personas: the geek, the math whiz, the prodigy! These are dangerous
                        misconceptions that often deter everyday people, with ample potential for success, from pursuing
                        careers as programmers. Well it’s time to put an end to these fallacies, and by the end we hope
                        you can make a more educated decision about a possible career in coding and the next step in
                        learning how to become a software developer. </p>
                    <h1 class="middle-title">Anyone can learn how to become a software developer</h1>
                    <p>
                        Software engineers, developers, devs, programming architects – whatever you wish to call them –
                        are not geniuses. Like members of any industry, their skillfulness lies on a spectrum from
                        excellent to poor. On the good side, you will find programmers with either remarkable talent or
                        work ethic, maybe both; and on the bad side, well you can imagine. But on any point of this
                        spectrum, good or bad, you will find ordinary people, just like you. Because to get into this
                        industry, everyone follows the same path: learning the technology and theory, and then
                        implementing the learning through projects until mastery is achieved. That’s all there is to it.
                        <span style="font-weight: 900; color: white;"> <br>No one is more “destined” to become a
                            software developer than you, and vice versa.</span>
                    </p>

                    <h1 class="middle-title">There is no ‘best’ language to learn.</h1>

                    <p>
                        The requirements of a project will determine the ‘best’ programming language to use, and even
                        then, you will need to use multiple languages to complete a project. This is because many
                        languages work together, not against each other. Each language has an intended purpose within a
                        given project. For example, Javascript is historically a front–end language intended for UI
                        development; meanwhile, PHP is a back–end language intended for back–end development. You may
                        not know what this means precisely, but the bottom line is that comparing certain languages is
                        like comparing a hammer to a screwdriver: they are designed for different tasks but together
                        achieve a common goal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to working together, some programming languages are comparable and may essentially
                        supply the same functionality: PHP is comparable to other back–end languages such as Java, Perl,
                        or Ruby. However this fundamental commonality doesn’t precisely equate to PHP being easily
                        substitutable by Java, Perl, or Ruby. Similarly, weighing comparable programming languages is
                        like comparing Chinese to Spanish: they share insightful similarities but at the same time,
                        critical differences. For brevity’s sake, here’s a great article on the topic that compares PHP
                        versus Ruby.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In summary, learning the ‘best’ programming language is not your secret ingredient to become a
                        software developer. As you contemplate a career in programming, disregard this trivial curiosity
                        and focus on getting your feet wet: start playing with code in order to learn the basics and
                        fundamentals. Completing a mini–personal project is often the best source for motivation, and
                        will ultimately decide which language to start with. And as your ability to program advances and
                        knowledge expands, you will gradually discover the intricacies of each language and further
                        understand why there is no ‘best’ programming language in the industry. For now, just start
                        coding as soon as possible.

                        In fact, computer technology is often central to much scientific research. This research
                        requires
                        not just domain experts, such as medical and environmental researchers, but also people with
                        deep
                        knowledge of computer technology who are able to develop algorithms and complex applications to
                        facilitate scientific research.
