                    <p>
                        Web programming, also known as web development, is the creation of dynamic web
                        applications.
                        Examples of web applications are social networking sites like Facebook or e-commerce
                        sites
                        like Amazon.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The good news is that learning web development is not that hard!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In fact, many argue it’s the best form of coding for beginners to learn. It’s easy to
                        set
                        up, you get instant results and there’s plenty of online training available.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A lot of people learn web coding because they want to create the next Facebook or find a
                        job
                        in the industry. But it’s also a good choice if you just want a general introduction to
                        coding, since it’s super easy to get started. No matter whether you’re looking for a
                        career
                        or just want to learn coding, learning how to develop for the web is for you. It’s one
                        of
                        the smartest decisions you will ever make!

                    <h1 class="middle-title">Web Development Overview</h1>
                    <p>
                        There are two broad divisions of web development – front-end development (also called
                        client-side development) and back-end development (also called server-side development).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Front-end development refers to constructing what a user sees when they load a web
                        application – the content, design and how you interact with it. This is done with three
                        codes – HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        HTML, short for Hyper Text Markup Language, is a special code for ‘marking up’ text in
                        order to turn it into a web page. Every web page on the net is written in HTML, and it
                        will form the backbone of any web application. CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is
                        a code for setting style rules for the appearance of web pages. CSS handles the cosmetic
                        side of the web. Finally, JavaScript is a scripting language that’s widely used to add
                        functionality and interactivity to web pages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Back-end development controls what goes on behind the scenes of a web application. A
                        back-end often uses a database to generate the front-end.

                    <h1 class="middle-title">Ways to Learn Web Development</h1>
                    <p>
                        The traditional way to learn web development is to enroll in a university or trade
                        school
                        course. However, it can be costly – and what’s more, the web evolves so fast that
                        schools
                        often can’t keep up!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Luckily, there’s plenty of good quality coding training available here on the Internet.
                        What
                        better place to learn web development than the web itself?

                    <p>
                        A particular training recommendation is Treehouse. This is because it has a focus on web
                        development, is recommended by many of the world’s most trusted and recognized web
                        developers (such as Chris Coyier) and most of its teachers are themselves web
                        developers.

                    <h1 class=middle-title>Teach It To Yourself</h1>
                    <p>
                        You could also learn web coding by researching it on your own, tweaking website
                        templates and inspecting the source code of other websites. A lot of coders learn HTML
                        and CSS this way, using website editing software to tweak a website template and
                        figuring out the code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, this method is not ideal. It takes a very long time, and you don’t even know
                        what there is to learn. It’s like having to first find the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle
                        before you can assemble them. You’re better off with training like Treehouse.
