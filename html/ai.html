                    <p>
                        Artificial intelligence (AI), also known as machine intelligence, is a branch of computer
                        science that aims to imbue software with the ability to analyze its environment using either
                        predetermined rules and search algorithms, or pattern recognizing machine learning models, and
                        then make decisions based on those analyses.
                    </p>
                    <div class="iframe-container">
                        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-RiiXVUrAdc" frameborder="0"
                            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
                            allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        In this way, AI attempts to mimic biological intelligence to allow the software application or
                        system to act with varying degrees of autonomy, thereby reducing manual human intervention for a
                        wide range of functions.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="overview">
                    <h1 class="big-title">Overview</h1>
                    <p>
                        While AI often invokes images of the sentient computer overlord of science fiction, the current
                        reality is far different. At its heart, AI uses the same basic algorithmic functions that drive
                        traditional software, but applies them in a different way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A standard warehouse management system, for example, can show the current levels of various
                        products, while an intelligent one could identify shortages, analyze the cause and its effect on
                        the
                        overall supply chain, and even take steps to correct it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Artificial intelligence can be allowed to replace a whole system, making all decisions
                        end-to-end,
                        or it can be used to enhance a specific process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, analyzing video footage to recognize gestures, or replacing peripheral devices
                        (keyboard, mouse, touchscreen) with a speech to text system., giving the impression that one is
                        interacting with a sentient being.
