                    <p>
                        Using a basic definition, software means computer programs and their associated documentation.
                        Computer programs, in turn, consist of algorithms (or procedures) applied to various types of
                        data. Software engineering emerged in the late 1960s as a new engineering discipline concerned
                        with all aspects pertaining to software production. It encompasses concepts, principles,
                        theories, techniques and tools that can be used for developing high-quality professional
                        software. First introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference in Garmisch,
                        Germany, software engineering emphasizes a systematic, disciplined approach to software
                        development and evolution and typically applies to the construction of large software systems
                        (or products) in which teams of numerous software engineers are involved.

                    </div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>High dependability (including safety, security and reliability)</li>
                        <li>Efficiency</li>
                        <li>Usability</li>
                        <li>Accessibility</li>

                    <p>
                        A software product is said to have a life-cycle, or undergo a software process, which in
                        software engineering terms consists essentially of two parts: development and evolution. Both
                        involve traditional engineering phases, software development consisting primarily of concept
                        creation, requirements specification, design, implementation, integration, testing, and
                        deployment. On the other hand, software evolution involves operation and maintenance as well as
                        some limited development activities aimed at improving the software.

                        <p>Software engineering applications are practically unlimited. In fact, software engineering
                            has grown
                            so fast in the last several decades that it has become tightly connected with all other
                            areas of
                            computer science (e.g., artificial intelligence, parallel processing, computer graphics,
                            human-computer interaction, database management systems, and many others) as well as with
                            some
                            areas
                            outside the traditional computer domain (such as cognitive sciences and visual arts).
