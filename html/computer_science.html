                    <p>
                        From creating computer games to programming technology for the CIA or building the next
                        Facebook, there are a lot of amazing things you can do with a computer science degree. It’s an
                        exciting and constantly evolving field with virtually unlimited growth. And did you know that
                        several successful celebrities are former computer science majors? Facebook creator Mark
                        Zuckerberg, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and even comedian Jimmy Fallon all got
                        their start by studying computer science.
